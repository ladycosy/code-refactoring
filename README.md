# HTML CSS: Code Refactor

This is a first assignment (week 1) for frontend development course. Working independently I will refactor already existing code of a Horiseon website (page's screenshot below). The goal is to improve website's accessibility by exchanging non-semantic to semantic tags or implementing image alt attribute. These updates will remove barriers to interact with the website for those with disabilities and also the browsers will be able to more accurately recognize content of our page.    

## Challenge Guide 

It is on-the-job ticket, which means I'll begin with starter code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. The goal is to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I will review the HTML and CSS code in VS Code program.

## User Story

AS a marketing agency 

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards 

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards. This can be achieved by completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
