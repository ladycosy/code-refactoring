# HTML CSS: Code Refactoring

I will refactor already existing code of a Horiseon website. The goal is to improve website's accessibility by exchanging non-semantic to semantic tags and implementing image alt attribute. These updates will remove barriers to interact with the website for those with disabilities and also the browsers will be able to more accurately recognize content of our page.    

## Overview

It is on-the-job ticket, which means I begin with starter code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. The goal is to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I use `HTML and CSS` in `VS Code`.

## User Story
```
AS a marketing agency 
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards 
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards. This can be achieved by completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
