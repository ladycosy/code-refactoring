# Challenge 1 - HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This is a first assignment (week 1) for frontend development course.

## Challenge Guide 

It is on-the-job ticket, which means I'll begin with starter code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. The goal is to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

### User Story

AS a marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet accessibility standards. This can be achieved by completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
